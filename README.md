# IncomePrediction
Binary classification of level of income (&lt;50USD K / >50 USD K per year) with algorithms.

Using data from Kaggle, (https://www.kaggle.com/lodetomasi1995/income-classification), about levels of income across the world, and variables about age, workclass, education,
race, sex (better described in Kaggle), among others, ML algorithms are designed in order to classify either a person earns more than 50K USD per year or not. 

In this repository some scripts will be added in order to task this problem in different ways, the first one being a XGBoosting Classifier method  (in Python) 
with levels of accuracy around 85%.
